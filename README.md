# ufo-import-cards
 This script takes a CSV file and imports the card numbers into UniFLOW Online

# Usage
 `run.example.bat` is provided to make it easier for you to run it. Just make a copy called `run.bat`, replace the parameters as necessary, and run it.

## Parameters
 `-Interactive`: If provided, will open a small window where you'll be asked to log in with your UniFLOW Online credentials
 `-Domain`: Required. This is your email provider's domain (e.g. `mycompany.net`) and is combined with the `login` read from the CSV file to make an email address (e.g. `SMIITJOH1@mycompany.net`)
 `-UFOURL`: Required. This is the URL to your UniFLOW Online tenant and will look like `mycompany.au.uniflowonline.com
 `-UFOClientId`: Required if `-Interactive` is set. This will be your UniFLOW Client ID, generated from the UFO website (see below)
 `-UFOClientSecret`: Required if `-Interactive` is set. This will be the client secret.

# Generating a UniFLOW Client ID and Secret
 These two can be generated by going to `UniFLOW Online > Users > [Search for your username] > User Applications > Add Credentials`
 These credentials will last for a month from when they were generated. There's no way to extend the date. It may be easier to use `-Interactive`, but you'll be prompted to log in every time

# CSV File
 The CSV file must be in this format:

 | login    | tid      |
 |----------|----------|
 | SMITJOH1 | ABCDEF12 |
 | SOMEONE2 | 21FEDCBA |
 | GREESAL1 | DEADBEEF |

`login` is the username part of their email address and MUST be in this format: `[A-Za-z]{3,7}\d` or in other words, between 3 and 7 letters long and exactly one digit at the end.
`tid` MUST be a hexadecimal string of exactly 8 characters (`[A-Za-z0-9]{8}`) and is the card number. Make sure to test one of the card numbers at the printer before bulk-adding
